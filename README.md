# Master Sintering Curve
 # Master Sintering Curve Plotter  This Python code implements a Master Sintering Curve (MSC) plotter based on the work of Suzanne J. Lombardo and Randall M. German. The MSC is a powerful tool used in materials science and engineering to model and predict the densification behavior of ceramic materials during sintering.  ## How it Works  The code uses a least-squares regression approach to determine the optimal activation energy (Q) for the sintering process. It then plots the relative density as a function of a combined time-temperature parameter, known as the "theta" value. This plot represents the Master Sintering Curve.  **Key Features:**  *   Calculates the Mean Residual Square (MRS) for a range of Q values. *   Identifies the optimal Q value that minimizes the MRS. *   Plots the MRS vs. Q curve to visualize the optimization process. *   Plots the Master Sintering Curve using the optimal Q value. *   Provides the optimal Q value and minimum MRS as output.  ## Usage  1.  **Input Data:** The code prompts the user to enter the following data:     *   Number of data points (n)     *   Time values (space-separated)     *   Temperature values (space-separated)     *   Relative density values (dL/L, space-separated) 2.  **Calculation and Plotting:**     *   The code calculates the MRS for a range of Q values.     *   It determines the optimal Q value that minimizes the MRS.     *   It generates two plots:         *   MRS vs. Q curve         *   Master Sintering Curve 3.  **Output:**     *   The code prints the optimal Q value and minimum MRS.     *   It also returns these values along with the calculated log(theta) values and relative density data.  ## Dependencies  *   NumPy *   Matplotlib *   SciPy  ## Installation  Make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries.
